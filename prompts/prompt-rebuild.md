# TASK — Rebuild UI From Stitch Designs

You are rebuilding the website interface using provided Stitch design images.

These images represent MOBILE-FIRST DESIGN REFERENCES.

You must translate them into a clean responsive website.

---

## IMPORTANT

DO NOT redesign.
DO NOT reinterpret creatively.
Translate faithfully into production-quality UI.

---

## Website Nature

This is a responsive WEBSITE.

Not a mobile application.

Mobile visuals are references only.

You must adapt intelligently for:

- mobile
- tablet
- desktop
- large screens

---

## Responsive Behaviour

Mobile:
match Stitch visuals closely.

Tablet:
increase spacing and readability.

Desktop:
use centered editorial layouts.
Introduce multi-column layouts when appropriate.

Never stretch mobile UI.

---

## Homepage Structure

Must follow:

1. Hero experience promise
2. Introduction section
3. Experience navigation slider
4. Experience narrative blocks
5. Premium proof section
6. Professional teaser
7. Intervention area
8. FAQ
9. Final CTA

---

## Experience Blocks

Each massage is an EXPERIENCE.

Structure:

1. Emotional promise
2. Sensory description
3. Ideal for
4. Experience flow
5. Duration selector
6. Price shown last
7. CTA

Never display pricing grids.

---

## Slider Behaviour

Navigation only.

- no aggressive autoplay
- user controlled
- scroll or anchor navigation

---

## Sticky Mobile CTA

Create persistent bottom CTA:

"Réserver un massage"

Rules:
- mobile only
- appears after hero
- hidden on reservation pages
- links to `/reservation`

---

## Professional Page

Communicate:

- zero management burden
- turnkey service
- premium guest experience

Tone must remain calm and elegant.

---

## Technical Stack

Use existing project stack:

- Next.js App Router
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS

Reuse repository architecture.

Do not introduce new frameworks.

---

## Component Expectations

Create reusable components:

- HeroSection
- ExperienceSlider
- ExperienceBlock
- DurationSelector
- PremiumProof
- ProfessionalTeaser
- FAQSection
- StickyBookingCTA
- Footer

Keep components small.

---

## Visual Priority

Preserve:

- spacing proportions
- typography hierarchy
- calm vertical rhythm
- minimal UI density

If uncertain:
choose minimalism.

Luxury websites remove elements instead of adding them.

---

## Output

Generate responsive UI aligned with Stitch visuals and project architecture.
